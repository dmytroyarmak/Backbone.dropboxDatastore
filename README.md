# Backbone Dropbox Datastore Adapter v0.4.1

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/dmytroyarmak/Backbone.dropboxDatastore.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/dmytroyarmak/Backbone.dropboxDatastore)

Quite simply a Dropbox Datastore adapter for Backbone. It's a drop-in replacement for Backbone.Sync() to handle saving to a [Dropbox Datastore](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/datastore).

## Example Application

There is an implementation of TodoMVC using backbone.dropboxDatastore as storage.

* [Demo](https://dropboxdatastore.herokuapp.com/)
* [Code in Github](https://github.com/dmytroyarmak/todomvc-backbone.dropboxDatastore)

## Usage

You need to have registered application with an OAuth redirect URI registered on the [App Console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps) before using the Dropbox Datastore API.

Include [Datastore API SDKs](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/datastore/sdks/js) and Backbone.dropboxDatastore after having included Backbone.js:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="backbone.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="backbone.dropboxDatastore.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.dropbox.com/static/api/dropbox-datastores-1.0-latest.js"></script>
```

To start using the Datastore API, you'll need to create a Client object. This object lets you link to a Dropbox user's account, which is the first step to working with data on their behalf.

You'll want to create the client object as soon as your app has loaded. Depending on your JavaScript framework, this can be done in a variety of different ways. For example, in jQuery, you would use the $() function.

After authentication you should set client object to Backbone.DropboxDatastore.client property.

*Be sure to replace APP_KEY with the real value for your app.*

```javascript
var client = new Dropbox.Client({key: APP_KEY});

// Try to finish OAuth authorization.
client.authenticate({interactive: false});

// Redirect to Dropbox to authenticate if client isn't authenticated
if (!client.isAuthenticated()) client.authenticate();

// Set client for Backbone.DropboxDatastore to work with Dropbox
Backbone.DropboxDatastore.client = client;

// Client is authenticated and set for Backbone.DropboxDatastore.
// You can use CRUD methods of collection with DropboxDatastore
```

Create your collections like so:

```javascript
window.SomeCollection = Backbone.Collection.extend({

  dropboxDatastore: new Backbone.DropboxDatastore('SomeCollection'), // Unique name within your app.

  // ... everything else is normal.

});
```

For more details how Dropbox Datastore API works read tutorial: [Using the Datastore API in JavaScript](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/datastore/tutorial/js)

### Custom Datastore ID

By default collections store on default Datastore. If you want use specific datastore pass options object as second attribute to Backbone.DropboxDatastore with property datastoreId:

```javascript
window.SomeCollection = Backbone.Collection.extend({

  dropboxDatastore: new Backbone.DropboxDatastore('SomeCollection', {
    datastoreId: 'MyCustomDatastore'
  }),

  // ... everything else is normal.

});
```

### Checking the datastore sync status

When your app makes a change to a datastore, that change is queued up locally and sent to Dropbox asynchronously. This means that there's a period of time between when a change is made and when that change has been uploaded to Dropbox.

To get current status of datastore you can just call getStatus() on dropboxDatastore object that returns 'uploading' or 'synced':

```javascript
var currentStatus = myCollection.dropboxDatastore.getStatus();

if (currentStatus === 'uploading') {
  // There are data that are not saved to Dropbox
} else if (currentStatus === 'synced') {
  // All data are saved to Dropbox
}
````

Also you can listen to change status event on dropboxDatastore:

```javascript
myCollection.dropboxDatastore.on('change:status', function(status, dropboxDatastore){
  // do something...
});

````

### Closing dropboxDatastore

To fully removing created dropboxDatastore you should call close method on dropboxDatastore.

```javascript
myCollection.dropboxDatastore.close();
````

### RequireJS

Include [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org):

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="lib/require.js"></script>
```

RequireJS config:
```javascript
require.config({
    paths: {
        jquery: 'lib/jquery',
        underscore: 'lib/underscore',
        backbone: 'lib/backbone',
        dropbox: 'https://www.dropbox.com/static/api/dropbox-datastores-1.0-latest',
        dropboxdatastore: 'lib/backbone.dropboxDatastore'
    }
});
```

*Create client, authorize it and set to Backbone.DropboxDatastore.client as in previous section.*

Define your collection as a module:
```javascript
define('someCollection', ['dropboxdatastore'], function() {
    var SomeCollection = Backbone.Collection.extend({
        dropboxDatastore: new Backbone.DropboxDatastore('SomeCollection') // Unique name within your app.
    });

    return new SomeCollection();
});
```

Require your collection:
```javascript
require(['someCollection'], function(someCollection) {
  // ready to use someCollection
});
```

### CommonJS

If you're using [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify).

```javascript
Backbone.DropboxDatastore = require('backbone.dropboxdatastore');
```

## Contributing

You'll need node and to `npm install` before being able to run the minification script.

Also to install dependencies for tests you need to `npm install -g bower` and then `bower install`.

1. Fork;
2. Write code, with tests;
4. Run tests with `npm test`
5. Create a pull request.

Have fun!
